## Understanding GitHub merge

Consider creating a pull request, which merge the branch named [pull-request](https://github.com/wataash/git-test-github-merge/commits/pull-request) into [master](https://github.com/wataash/git-test-github-merge/commits/master) branch.

This commit graph is generated by [tig](https://github.com/jonas/tig) command (`tig master pull-request`).
(On Windows, I recommend [Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) to generate commit graphs.)

When merging the pull request, there are three options:

- [Create a merge commit](https://github.com/wataash/git-test-github-merge/pull/1)
- [Squash and merge](https://github.com/wataash/git-test-github-merge/pull/2)
- [Rebase and merge](https://github.com/wataash/git-test-github-merge/pull/3)

After merging, the commit graphs will be look like these:

### Create a merge commit

### Squash and merge

Note that the commit authors (charles and donald) have been replaced with the merger (wataash).
`git show --pretty=full squash-and-merge`:

```
commit decb2967fed0c8bf776055abdeeb70db5c4680e3 (origin/squash-and-merge, squash-and-merge)
Author: Wataru Ashihara <wataash@users.noreply.github.com>
Commit: GitHub <noreply@github.com>

    Try "Squash and merge" (#2)
    
    * commit C
    
    * commit D

diff --git a/c.txt b/c.txt
new file mode 100644
index 0000000..e69de29
diff --git a/d.txt b/d.txt
new file mode 100644
index 0000000..e69de29
```

When merging by "Squash and merge", the author will be the merger and the committer will be "GitHub".
Personally I don't prefer "Squash and merge" since the contributions, which can be seen in ["Insights"](https://github.com/wataash/git-test-github-merge/graphs/contributors), seems to be lost. If you want to squash commits, I recommend using [`git rebase --interactive`](https://github.com/wataash/git-test-squash)

### Rebase and merge

Though the authors are not changed, the committer are changed to `GitHub Name <account@users.noreply.github.com>`. `git log --pretty=full -2 rebase-and-merge`:

```
commit 24c02be4250587e26ded87f84ba157414593f35f (origin/rebase-and-merge, rebase-and-merge)
Author: Donald Dijkstra <donald@example.com>
Commit: Wataru Ashihara <wataash@users.noreply.github.com>

    commit D

commit 6fa84589a2af5f3234d647a097046f4e7847c420
Author: Charles Codd <charles@example.com>
Commit: Wataru Ashihara <wataash@users.noreply.github.com>

    commit C
```

### Miscellaneous
To get grasp of the commit-graph status, always use a visualizing tool (`tig --all` [Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/), [SmartGit](https://www.syntevo.com/smartgit/) or so on).
